# How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This was my first experience with OpenGL and every skill I used in the project was developed over the course of the term! I would say the biggest design skill I learned was the use of meshes to create reusable code that allowed me to create multiple objects very quickly while also maintaining readability.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I tried to maintain OOP standards when designing my final project allowing for reworks to be done quickly and efficiently. This also ensured that the final project was as modular as possible and helped with reusability and readability. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
OOP can be and should be applied to all my future coding projects. I will also try to create programs like meshes that can be called at any point in time to help alleviate some of the design issues that I ran into in this course.

# How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The use of calling meshes was one of the most helpful and new design strategies that I employed during this course. I made creating object withing my 3D scene much easier and quicker. It also allowed for easier scaling and translations of the objects as well. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
The iterations provided in each module were extremely helpful in my development. It was nice to work on just one aspect as a time like lighting or textures. This project in the bigging seemed a little overwhelming for me but the iteration provided in the course helped break the project down into smaller more manageable steps. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
I don’t know if my approach to coding has changed throughout the course but my understanding of the code and how to implement it sure did. I have always been a developer who tries to code in iterations and the milestones provided a really good guide for that process that I already used. 

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I believe that these skills could be used on future projects if I need to create a design or an image in 3D for a webpage in future courses. I would like to try and implement the skills learned in this course to courses in the future if possible.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I am not sure if I will be doing any computational graphics and visualization in my future profession! I start my internship with the Airforce this June and I don’t believe they do any of this kind of work on the projects I will be involved in, But if they do I will have a great leg up based on the understanding and skills I have developed during this course.
